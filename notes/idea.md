How does a human identify garbage? I know that almost all the garbage is made up of *common* things found in *undesirable* places. For instance, I know that a polythene bag is great in a shop - unwanted if on the roadside. Similarly, food, while great in a plate, is garbage if its on the side of the road.

Further, as a human, I inherently 'know' the degree of filth associated with garbage. I know that a rotting sandwich is filthy - but I also know its completely degradable. The wrapper of the sandwich ofn the other hand is not as filthy, probably even clean - but its a bigger threat to nature.

So I think, i'll start off with a simple plastic picker. Primarily plastic on the roadside is in the form of :-
	- Poly grocery bags
	- Potato Chip and other packaging
	- Plastic water bottles
	- Aluminium foil (to a small degree)
	- Glass from booze etc
	- Cigarette stubs
	- Cigarette packets
	- Candy wrappers/Chocolate wrappers

Ideally, as a first project, it would be awesome to be able to segment garbage from surroundings. While interesting, it is problematic because in this case, in the open world, environment is infinitely complex.

How can I isolate plastic bag image from the rest of the background? Which could be made up of street, road side, people in background (passerby) beach, etc. 

Pertinent questions - can ML be used for segmentation? **Should** ML be used used for segmentation? Is segmentation itself useful for this?
