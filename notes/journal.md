How does a human identify garbage? I know that almost all the garbage is made up of *common* things found in *undesirable* places. For instance, I know that a polythene bag is great in a shop - unwanted if on the roadside. Similarly, food, while great in a plate, is garbage if its on the side of the road.

Further, as a human, I inherently 'know' the degree of filth associated with garbage. I know that a rotting sandwich is filthy - but I also know its completely degradable. The wrapper of the sandwich ofn the other hand is not as filthy, probably even clean - but its a bigger threat to nature.

So I think, i'll start off with a simple plastic picker. Primarily plastic on the roadside is in the form of :-
	- Poly grocery bags
	- Potato Chip and other packaging
	- Plastic water bottles
	- Aluminium foil (to a small degree)
	- Glass from booze etc
	- Cigarette stubs
	- Cigarette packets
	- Candy wrappers/Chocolate wrappers

Ideally, as a first project, it would be awesome to be able to segment garbage from surroundings. While interesting, it is problematic because in this case, in the open world, environment is infinitely complex.

How can I isolate plastic bag image from the rest of the background? Which could be made up of street, road side, people in background (passerby) beach, etc. 

Pertinent questions - can ML be used for segmentation? **Should** ML be used used for segmentation? Is segmentation itself useful for this?

How do we make sure we scan the entire landscape? 

What is the target market? Typically, the problem of garbage collection itself has been solved by the simplest of means - human labor. In advanced countries where labor may not exist for such tasks - the problem itself doesn't exist because people have civic sense. In countries like India, labor is cheap. So if someone cares about cleanliness in a given place - they pay someone to clean it. Cheap and easy.

Only government can potentially care about keeping public places clean. But why would government buy the robot? Instead it can pay someone to clean as well, if they wanted to. And put it under a scheme like NREGA.

Only argument has to be ease of use and maintainence. Solar panel would need to power the robot - it shouldn't need charging.

And what about security? Won't people just lift these bots off the streets if no one is manning them? Like any other unsecured govt. property?

And what about maintainance? Who will maintain all these robots in all parts of the country?

What about other alternatives? Having personal bikes or cars that can transform into defensive bots? Or better - what about small portable defense bots. That CANNOT be reprogrammed to be dangerous - only as a defense tool. If we make this affordable and get people to trust the tech - we potentially have a product. Two ideas. Need to weigh. Need to consider what can be developed. Can easily overtake invento - but we need some way to get funding and people. I need help. Not sure where to get it.
