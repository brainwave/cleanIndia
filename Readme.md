I took my motorbike, cruising through the serene, pristine valley of Dehradun. Mountains, clouds, and river converge beautifully. And thats why you spot it. You can't ignore it once you have seen it and what would otherwise have been a great drive makes you fundamentally depressed. Thats right. You see an endless array of plastic trash scattered all along the road. From the bottom of the valley all the way to the hillstation of mussorie. Its there everywhere. Penetrating several layers into the soil. And you see how it reached there - every few seconds passerbys throw something. Invariably non-biodegradable.

As a citizen - I want to change it. As a single human being, I can't. I can't make them stop and not throw things - humans will be humans. I can only pick it up except I possible *can't*. So many bags.

That is how the idea for a cleaning robot was concieved. Over time, i'll add into this repository code for a robot that can

- traverse all terrains
- identify trash
- identify *type* of trash.
- pick it up
- compress it/partially digest it
- deliver it to a facility
- charges itself
- maybe even collects revenue from passerby (begging robot) for maintainance. Gimicky but practical.
- maybe defends people in a situation. Just like a police dog.
